This project does not use a ChangeLog file.

The source code of this project is managed by the Subversion revision
control system (http://subversion.tigris.org), a very nice replacement
for the venerable CVS.  One of the many nice features of Subversion is
the 'log' command, which will give you the equivalent of a GNU style
ChangeLog file.

To view the Subversion log for this project you must have a Subversion
client installed.  Type on the command line

	$ svn://svn.linux1394.org/libraw1394/trunk

to view the log.
