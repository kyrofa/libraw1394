Description: Check that /dev/raw1394 permissions are appropriate for you.
 The device file /dev/raw1394 will be created for libraw1394.  This library is
 used by applications to access FireWire devices.
 .
 The default access permissions allows only users in the "disk" group.  This
 restrictive setting was chosen since raw1394 allows almost full access to the
 FireWire bus and all connected devices are accessible, which may include hard
 disks.
 .
 If you don't intend to connect sensitive devices and e.g. only want to get
 video streams out of a camera, you can relax the permissions.  If you don't
 have malicious users on your system, you can allow access for all users with
 this command (executed as the root user):
     chmod 666 /dev/raw1394
