/dev/raw1394 created.

It is owned by root with read/write permissions for root.  You may
want to fix the group/permission to something appropriate for you.
Note however that anyone who can open raw1394 can access all devices
on all connected 1394 buses unrestricted, including harddisks and
other probably sensitive devices.

/dev/raw1394 not created.  You can create it at a later time using
/dev/MAKEDEV if you have a version that already knows raw1394 or you
can create it manually with the command:

    mknod -m600 /dev/raw1394 c 171 0
